# slush-hapijs 

> Slush generator to scaffold out HapiJS APIs. Includes JWT authentication and Swagger docs built in


## Getting Started

Welcome to the HapiJS REST API generator for Slush. Slush-hapijs will scaffold out a HapiJS API server. 

### Prerequisites
As with any Slush generator, you will need to have **Node** and **Slush** installed globally.

Install `slush` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush
```
After you have all the prerequisites installed, install the **Slush-hapijs** generator globally. 

Install `slush-hapijs` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-hapijs
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-project
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-project 
$ slush hapijs
```

There are some basic scaffolding questions to help get your application built out. During the scaffolding process, it will install all node modules. 


## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.
